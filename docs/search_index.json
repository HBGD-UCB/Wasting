While other cohort data from the Kenaba area show that children tend to experience decreased LAZ after birth, in the MRC Kenaba data used in this analysis, we see a high birth LAZ (approximately 0) and a rapid drop in LAZ in followup measurements (approximately -1 at one month). we see that the at birth measurements LAZ is ~0, and then for the follow-up measurements after the mean LAZ is ~ -1 (and the mean LAZ of just the subsequent follow-up visit at one month is ~ -1). We calculated 30% of measurements taken within two weeks of birth are lower than the at birth measurement beyond the technical error of measurement, and so are unrealistic decreases in child length, and 43% of follow-up measurements within two weeks of birth are less than the at-birth measurement by any amount. 4.1 Mean WLZ by region 4.2 Age-specific prevalence 4.3 Age-specific incidence 4.4 Age-specific incidence rate 4.5 Age-specific recovery 4.6 Age-specific prevalence of severe wasting 4.7 Age-specific longitudinal prevalence of persistent wasting 4.8 Age-specific prevalence of concurrent wasting and stunting 4.9 Age-specific prevalence of underweight (weight-for-age Z-score &lt; -2) "]]
